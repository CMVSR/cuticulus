## plan

# experiments

1. experiment to explore how cnn classifies full-sized images (rough vs smooth)
2. experiment #1 with gabor filter
   a. how to select parameters?
   b. how to apply kernels (x filters gives x output images)
3. experiment #1 with data augmentation method from dr hung
4. experiment cnn subimage classification (rough vs smooth) with gabor filter
5. experiment kviews subimage classification (rough vs smooth) with gabor filter

# infrastructure

1. generate latex table from experimental results
