  abstract = {SUMMARY
            Factors that affect water loss rates (WLRs) are poorly known for
            organisms in natural habitats. Seed-harvester ant queens provide an
            ideal system for examining such factors because WLRs for mated
            queens excavated from their incipient nests are twofold to threefold
            higher than those of alate queens. Indirect data suggest that this
            increase results from soil particles abrading the cuticle during
            nest excavation. This study provides direct support for the cuticle
            abrasion hypothesis by measuring total mass-specific WLRs, cuticular
            abrasion, cuticular transpiration, respiratory water loss and
            metabolic rate for queens of the ant Messor pergandei at three
            stages: unmated alate queens, newly mated dealate queens (undug
            foundresses) and mated queens excavated from their incipient nest
            (dug foundresses); in addition we examined these processes in
            artificially abraded alate queens. Alate queens had low WLRs and low
            levels of cuticle abrasion, whereas dug foundresses had high WLRs
            and high levels of cuticle abrasion. Total WLR and cuticular
            transpiration were lowest for alate queens, intermediate for undug
            foundresses and highest for dug foundresses. Respiratory water loss
            contributed ∼10\% of the total WLR and was lower for alate queens
            and undug foundresses than for dug foundresses. Metabolic rate did
            not vary across stages. Total WLR and cuticular transpiration of
            artificially abraded alate queens increased, whereas respiratory
            water loss and metabolic rate were unaffected. Overall, increased
            cuticular transpiration accounted for essentially all the increased
            total water loss in undug and dug foundresses and artificially
            abraded queens. Artificially abraded queens and dug foundresses
            showed partial recovery after 14 days.},

  abstract = {:
              Chitin contributes to the rigidity of the insect cuticle and
              serves as an attachment matrix for other cuticular
proteins. Deficiency of chitin results in abnormal embryos, cuticular structural
defects and growth arrest. When chitin is not turned over during molting, the
developing insect is trapped inside the old cuticle. Partial deacetylation of
cuticular chitin is also required for proper laminar organization of the cuticle
and vertical pore canals, molting, and locomotion. Thus, chitin and its
modifications strongly influence the structure of the exoskeleton as well as the
physiological functions of the insect.
            
            
              : Internal tendons and specialized epithelial cells called “tendon
              cells” that arise from the outer layer of epidermal
cells provide attachment sites at both ends of adult limb muscles. Membrane
processes emanating from both tendon and muscle cells interdigitate extensively
to strengthen the attachment of muscles to the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Protein ligands that bind to membrane-bound integrin complexes further enhance
the adhesion between muscles and tendons. Tendon cells contain F-actin fiber
arrays that contribute to their rigidity. In the cytoplasm of muscle cells,
proteins such as talin and other proteins provide attachment sites for
cytoskeletal actin, thereby increasing integrin binding and activation to
mechanically couple the ECM with actin in muscle cells. Mutations in integrins
and their ligands, as well as depletion of chitin deacetylases, result in
defective locomotion and muscle detachment from the ECM. Thus, chitin in the
cuticle and chitin deacetylases strongly influence the shape and functions of
the exoskeleton as well as locomotion of insects.},
