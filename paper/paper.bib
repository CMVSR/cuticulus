  abstract    = {Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the great success stories in the history of life on Earth. From their first appearance in the Early Cretaceous, ants have come to occupy keystone positions in virtually all major terrestrial habitats, and they are absent only from Antarctica and a few inhospitable or remote islands. Despite the interest ants have long generated, our understanding of their taxonomy, diversity, evolution and ecology is far from complete. It is estimated that only half of the world's ant species - currently numbering about 12,200 - have been described. AntWeb's [www.antweb.org] mission is to develop tools to accelerate the discovery and documentation of ant diversity, and ensure ant information is widely accessible across a broad community. As such, AntWeb is the world's largest online database of images, specimen records, and natural history information on ants. A standardized digitizing protocol has been set up for extant species, which optimizes the image acquisition of each specimen in dorsal, profile, and head views, as well as the wings and male genitalia when applicable. As of July 2012, AntWeb has approximately 84000 high quality images of 20000 specimens representing over 9010 extant species. But the picture would be incomplete without the fossils. Recently the world catalogue of the fossil ants was added, which comprises 661 valid extinct species each represented by a single or few specimens disseminated in various fossil collections throughout the world. Besides the difficulty to access some of them, the main limitation to digitizing fossil ants is their mode of preservation. From spectacularly preserved specimens entombed within amber and showing the finest details of cuticular sculpturing, to the often shadowy outlines hinting at a structure that seems just out of view provided by an imprint, fossil ants often cannot be imaged following all the standards of extant specimens, and instead require specific methods for high quality image acquisition.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY
            Factors that affect water loss rates (WLRs) are poorly known for
            organisms in natural habitats. Seed-harvester ant queens provide an
            ideal system for examining such factors because WLRs for mated
            queens excavated from their incipient nests are twofold to threefold
            higher than those of alate queens. Indirect data suggest that this
            increase results from soil particles abrading the cuticle during
            nest excavation. This study provides direct support for the cuticle
            abrasion hypothesis by measuring total mass-specific WLRs, cuticular
            abrasion, cuticular transpiration, respiratory water loss and
            metabolic rate for queens of the ant Messor pergandei at three
            stages: unmated alate queens, newly mated dealate queens (undug
            foundresses) and mated queens excavated from their incipient nest
            (dug foundresses); in addition we examined these processes in
            artificially abraded alate queens. Alate queens had low WLRs and low
            levels of cuticle abrasion, whereas dug foundresses had high WLRs
            and high levels of cuticle abrasion. Total WLR and cuticular
            transpiration were lowest for alate queens, intermediate for undug
            foundresses and highest for dug foundresses. Respiratory water loss
            contributed ∼10\% of the total WLR and was lower for alate queens
            and undug foundresses than for dug foundresses. Metabolic rate did
            not vary across stages. Total WLR and cuticular transpiration of
            artificially abraded alate queens increased, whereas respiratory
            water loss and metabolic rate were unaffected. Overall, increased
            cuticular transpiration accounted for essentially all the increased
            total water loss in undug and dug foundresses and artificially
            abraded queens. Artificially abraded queens and dug foundresses
            showed partial recovery after 14 days.},

              Chitin contributes to the rigidity of the insect cuticle and
              serves as an attachment matrix for other cuticular
proteins. Deficiency of chitin results in abnormal embryos, cuticular structural
defects and growth arrest. When chitin is not turned over during molting, the
developing insect is trapped inside the old cuticle. Partial deacetylation of
cuticular chitin is also required for proper laminar organization of the cuticle
and vertical pore canals, molting, and locomotion. Thus, chitin and its
modifications strongly influence the structure of the exoskeleton as well as the
physiological functions of the insect.
            
            
              : Internal tendons and specialized epithelial cells called “tendon
              cells” that arise from the outer layer of epidermal
cells provide attachment sites at both ends of adult limb muscles. Membrane
processes emanating from both tendon and muscle cells interdigitate extensively
to strengthen the attachment of muscles to the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Protein ligands that bind to membrane-bound integrin complexes further enhance
the adhesion between muscles and tendons. Tendon cells contain F-actin fiber
arrays that contribute to their rigidity. In the cytoplasm of muscle cells,
proteins such as talin and other proteins provide attachment sites for
cytoskeletal actin, thereby increasing integrin binding and activation to
mechanically couple the ECM with actin in muscle cells. Mutations in integrins
and their ligands, as well as depletion of chitin deacetylases, result in
defective locomotion and muscle detachment from the ECM. Thus, chitin in the
cuticle and chitin deacetylases strongly influence the shape and functions of
the exoskeleton as well as locomotion of insects.},

Termed Statistical Macro Binary Pattern (SMBP), the descriptor is informative, rotation invariant, and it is designed to encode texture information from a large support area. The main novelty of this approach is the use of statistical description to represent the intensity distribution in the large support area, and an LBP-like encoding scheme to derive a statistical macro pattern by thresholding it against its adaptive statistical prototype. We propose to test three neighborhood sampling schemes according to the angular quantization at each level of the macrostructure. The comprehensive experiments on three challenging bark datasets (BarkTex, Trunk12, AFF) show that our descriptor achieves high and more consistent identification rates when compared with LBP-like texture descriptors.},
