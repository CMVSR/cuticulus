  abstract    = {Ants
  (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) are one of the great success stories in the history
  of life on Earth. From their first appearance in the Early Cretaceous, ants
  have come to occupy keystone positions in virtually all major terrestrial
  habitats, and they are absent only from Antarctica and a few inhospitable or
  remote islands. Despite the interest ants have long generated, our
  understanding of their taxonomy, diversity, evolution and ecology is far from
  complete. It is estimated that only half of the world's ant species -
  currently numbering about 12,200 - have been described. AntWeb's
  [www.antweb.org] mission is to develop tools to accelerate the discovery and
  documentation of ant diversity, and ensure ant information is widely
  accessible across a broad community. As such, AntWeb is the world's largest
  online database of images, specimen records, and natural history information
  on ants. A standardized digitizing protocol has been set up for extant
  species, which optimizes the image acquisition of each specimen in dorsal,
  profile, and head views, as well as the wings and male genitalia when
  applicable. As of July 2012, AntWeb has approximately 84000 high quality
  images of 20000 specimens representing over 9010 extant species. But the
  picture would be incomplete without the fossils. Recently the world catalogue
  of the fossil ants was added, which comprises 661 valid extinct species each
  represented by a single or few specimens disseminated in various fossil
  collections throughout the world. Besides the difficulty to access some of
  them, the main limitation to digitizing fossil ants is their mode of
  preservation. From spectacularly preserved specimens entombed within amber and
  showing the finest details of cuticular sculpturing, to the often shadowy
  outlines hinting at a structure that seems just out of view provided by an
  imprint, fossil ants often cannot be imaged following all the standards of
  extant specimens, and instead require specific methods for high quality image
  acquisition.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY
            Factors that affect water loss rates (WLRs) are poorly known for
            organisms in natural habitats. Seed-harvester ant queens provide an
            ideal system for examining such factors because WLRs for mated
            queens excavated from their incipient nests are twofold to threefold
            higher than those of alate queens. Indirect data suggest that this
            increase results from soil particles abrading the cuticle during
            nest excavation. This study provides direct support for the cuticle
            abrasion hypothesis by measuring total mass-specific WLRs, cuticular
            abrasion, cuticular transpiration, respiratory water loss and
            metabolic rate for queens of the ant Messor pergandei at three
            stages: unmated alate queens, newly mated dealate queens (undug
            foundresses) and mated queens excavated from their incipient nest
            (dug foundresses); in addition we examined these processes in
            artificially abraded alate queens. Alate queens had low WLRs and low
            levels of cuticle abrasion, whereas dug foundresses had high WLRs
            and high levels of cuticle abrasion. Total WLR and cuticular
            transpiration were lowest for alate queens, intermediate for undug
            foundresses and highest for dug foundresses. Respiratory water loss
            contributed ∼10\% of the total WLR and was lower for alate queens
            and undug foundresses than for dug foundresses. Metabolic rate did
            not vary across stages. Total WLR and cuticular transpiration of
            artificially abraded alate queens increased, whereas respiratory
            water loss and metabolic rate were unaffected. Overall, increased
            cuticular transpiration accounted for essentially all the increased
            total water loss in undug and dug foundresses and artificially
            abraded queens. Artificially abraded queens and dug foundresses
            showed partial recovery after 14 days.},

              Chitin contributes to the rigidity of the insect cuticle and
              serves as an attachment matrix for other cuticular
proteins. Deficiency of chitin results in abnormal embryos, cuticular structural
defects and growth arrest. When chitin is not turned over during molting, the
developing insect is trapped inside the old cuticle. Partial deacetylation of
cuticular chitin is also required for proper laminar organization of the cuticle
and vertical pore canals, molting, and locomotion. Thus, chitin and its
modifications strongly influence the structure of the exoskeleton as well as the
physiological functions of the insect.
            
            
              : Internal tendons and specialized epithelial cells called “tendon
              cells” that arise from the outer layer of epidermal
cells provide attachment sites at both ends of adult limb muscles. Membrane
processes emanating from both tendon and muscle cells interdigitate extensively
to strengthen the attachment of muscles to the extracellular matrix (ECM).
Protein ligands that bind to membrane-bound integrin complexes further enhance
the adhesion between muscles and tendons. Tendon cells contain F-actin fiber
arrays that contribute to their rigidity. In the cytoplasm of muscle cells,
proteins such as talin and other proteins provide attachment sites for
cytoskeletal actin, thereby increasing integrin binding and activation to
mechanically couple the ECM with actin in muscle cells. Mutations in integrins
and their ligands, as well as depletion of chitin deacetylases, result in
defective locomotion and muscle detachment from the ECM. Thus, chitin in the
cuticle and chitin deacetylases strongly influence the shape and functions of
the exoskeleton as well as locomotion of insects.},

  Termed Statistical Macro Binary Pattern (SMBP), the descriptor is informative,

  large support area. The main novelty of this approach is the use of
  statistical description to represent the intensity distribution in the large
  support area, and an LBP-like encoding scheme to derive a statistical macro
  pattern by thresholding it against its adaptive statistical prototype. We
  propose to test three neighborhood sampling schemes according to the angular
  quantization at each level of the macrostructure. The comprehensive
  experiments on three challenging bark datasets (BarkTex, Trunk12, AFF) show
  that our descriptor achieves high and more consistent identification rates

  dating analysis is an important research direction of document inspection,
  which is widely used in the inspection and identification of cultural relics
  and ancient books. This article focuses on the analysis of paper dating in
  ancient books, and proposes a non-destructive inspection and analysis method
  based on paper fiber texture images. Aiming at the global stacking morphology
  of paper fibers and the local features of specific types of fiber morphology,
  we propose a neural network-based hybrid texture feature extraction and
  representation method: On the one hand, we use convolutional networks to
  obtain global features of fiber texture; at the same time, we designed a
  method of extracting and representing local fiber morphological features based
  on the attention mechanism. By mixing the above two types of features, we
  realize the extraction and representation of paper fiber features.
  Furthermore, we use the GRU(Gate Recurrent Unit) model to establish a paper
  dating time series model and design a new loss function. In order to verify
  the method, this paper selects 36 domestic books published from 1950 to 2000,
  and uses the document checker VSC 6000 to collect paper texture images as a
  dataset, and verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method on this

  Fisher coefficient and classification accuracy were used to evaluate the

  classification was successful ({\textgreater}90.00\%) between MS lesions and
  NAWM or NWM, less successful (88.89\%) among the three tissue groups and worst
  (66.67\%) between NAWM and NWM; (2) In statistical analysis, NDA outperforms

	propose a machine learning approach that augments the traditional arrhythmia
	detection approaches via our automatic arrhythmia classification system. It
	utilizes the texture of the ECG signal in both the temporal and
	spectro-temporal domains to detect and classify four types of heartbeats. The
	original ECG signal is first preprocessed, and then, the R-peaks associated
	with heartbeat estimation are identified. Next, 1D local binary patterns (LBP)
	in the temporal domain are utilized, while 2D LBPs and texture-based features
	extracted by a grayscale co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) are utilized in the
	spectro-temporal domain using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and
	Morse wavelets. Finally, different classifiers, as well as different ECG lead
	configurations are examined before we determine our proposed time-frequency
	SVM model, which obtains a maximum accuracy of 99.81\%, sensitivity of
	98.17\%, and specificity of 99.98\% when using a 10 cross-validation on the
	MIT-BIH database. Our approach yields competitive accuracy when compared to
	other methods discussed in the literature.},

	essentially by hand based on some prior knowledge (e.g. perceptual models,

	convolutional networks for refactoring traditional, hand-designed filters. Our
	method consists of initialising the first convolutional layer of the network
	with some classic banks of filters, training the network on texture images and
	retrieve the modified filters. Experimenting with five classes of filters and
	eight datasets of texture images we show that the refactored filters can be
	conveniently used `off-the-shelf' to achieve better performance than obtained
	with the original filters, but at the same computational cost.},

	among the most devastating and deadly disasters likely to occur. Each year,
	thousands of people die as a result of rising river water levels and spring
	snow melts. Minimizing the impact of these events and providing necessary
	information to rescue teams on the ground requires the mobilization of all
	humanitarian stakeholders. This work aims to automate the extraction of
	flooded areas from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite images in order to
	accelerate the generation of damage maps during floods. Our approach is mainly
	based on the following steps: first, homogeneous surfaces contained in pre-
	and post-disaster images are extracted based on the Structural Feature Set
	(SFS) texture descriptor. Then, a morphological opening operator is applied to
	the resulting images in order to filter out small-sized objects and noise.
	Finally, the two gray levels images generated by applying the texture
	descriptor and the morphological operator are fused using fuzzy logic to
	identify flooded regions. SAR images acquired using the RADARSAT-2 satellite
	during the Richelieu River floods are used to evaluate the performance of the
	proposed technique, and the results obtained show the efficiency and
	robustness of the described approach.},

	invariant texture classification based on local binary patterns and
	nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. The method
	is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed "uniform,"
	are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence
	histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a
	generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that
	allows for detecting the "uniform" patterns for any quantization of the
	angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for
	combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed
	approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator
	is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray
	scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be
	realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table.
	Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with
	the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary
	patterns.},

	present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network
	architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core
	trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding
	decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The
	architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13
	convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1] . The role of the decoder
	network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input
	resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet
	lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution
	input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed
	in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear
	upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled
	maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense
	feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN
	[2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3] , DeconvNet [4]
	architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off
	involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily
	motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be
	efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It
	is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other
	competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic
	gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other
	architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation
	tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good
	performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference
	memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe
	implementation of SegNet and a web demo at
